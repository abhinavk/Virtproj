# Incorporating power usage monitoring in Infrastructure-as-a-Service monitor  
Git repository of VirtProj, our final year project.

# Description
VirtProj is a dashboard for monitoring and managing running nodes, accessed on desktop. It monitors all running domain and the host using libvirt library. Also generates a time-based report in PDF.

# Abstract
With the advent of cloud computing applications, monitoring becomes a valid concern. Monitoring for various aspects in a cloud application is difficult because of multiple failure points spanning both hardware and software. Moreover the cluster nature of a cloud application increases the scope of failure and cost and it becomes even harder to measure and manage the same. In this project, Infrastructure-as-a-Service Cloud Monitor, we monitor the virtual machines and the hosts running the virtual machines for attributes including power usage. This Cloud Manager is a desktop application and generates daily and weekly reports.
